# GeoCA
Geographical Simulation Application via Cellular Automata (GeoCA)

GeoCA is a free software for the simulation and prediction of a large-scale pixel-based urban development process.

GeoCA has been well applied in the fields of urban development process analysis, urban ecological environment analysis and urban planning.

GeoCA supports multi-rule mining models, multi-spatial variable processing, geographic location alignment, and automatic memory control for large-scale urban development simulation.

Important Notes:

Please download all GeoCA_V2.4.z01 ~ GeoCA_V2.4.z04 and GeoCA_V2.4.zip files before decompressing them, there are test data and executable files inside.

Please unzip the program to the full English file path. Double-click “GeoCA_UI.exe” in the program directory to start the GeoCA program.

If you encounter a program error, please install Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable.
